Developed by Rodrigo Carvalho (Visiophone) May 2015, UT Austin - Texas.
Based on the examples from Plethora library. 
Needs Plethora, peasyCam, ToxicGeo and OSCP5 Processing Libraries.

Boids behaviour parameters (cohesion, separation, aligmenet) are audio reactive.
Audio analyze and other parameters controls are done live in a VDMX project (https://vidvox.net/)
and sent by OSC (check all the messages in controlTab and the file "vdmxLiveControl.vdmx5").
